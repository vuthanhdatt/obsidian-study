### Determinants of the Level of Interest Rates

* We need to distinguish between a *nominal interest rate*  —the growth rate of your money—and a *real interest rate*—the growth rate of your purchasing power

 
				 $r_{\text {real }}=\frac{r_{\text {nom }}-i}{1+i}$
 
#### Taxes and the real rate of interest
for example, you are in a 30% tax bracket and your investments provide a nominal return of 12% while inflation runs at 8%, your before-tax real rate is approximately 4%, and you should, in an inflation-protected tax system, net an after-tax real return of 4%(1 − .3) = 2.8%. But the tax code does not recognize that the first 8% of your return is only compensation for inflation—not real income. Your after-tax nominal return is 12%(1 − .3) = 8.4%, so your after-tax real interest rate is only 8.4% − 8% = .4%. 

#### Comparing Rates of Return for Different Holding Periods

In order to compare rates of return for different periods, we should calculate *EFFECTIVE ANNUALLY RATE* (EAR)

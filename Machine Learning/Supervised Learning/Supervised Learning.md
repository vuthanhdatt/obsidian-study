## What is supervised learning
In supervised learning, we are given a data set and already know what our correct output should look like. Then trying to predict results.  Categorize into *classification* and *regression*
## [[Regression]]
- Predict with *continuous* output/map input variables to some *continuous* function
- 

## [[Classification]]

- Predict with *discrete* output/map input variables into *discrete* categories.

- In general, vectors are special objects that can be **added** together and **multiplied** by scalars to produce another object of the same kind. From an abstract mathematical viewpoint, any object that satisfies these two properties can be considered a vector
- Linear algebra focuses on the similarities between these vector concepts. We can add them together and multiply them by scalars
- 
- Scaling vector **scalar**

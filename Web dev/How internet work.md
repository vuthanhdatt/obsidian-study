## Simple network
- When two computers need to communicate, you have to link them, either physically (usually with an [Ethernet cable](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ethernet_crossover_cable)) or wirelessly (for example with [Wi-Fi](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/WiFi) or [Bluetooth](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bluetooth) systems). All modern computers can sustain any of those connections.

- To connect our network to the telephone infrastructure, we need a special piece of equipment called a _modem_. This _modem_ turns the information from our network into information manageable by the telephone infrastructure and vice versa.

- Then send information from our network to other network by connect to an Internet Service Provider (ISP). An IPS provider can access other IPS, so can send our message to our friend.

## IP address
- each computer has their own IP address to identify
- alias ip adress to *domain name*
## Internet and web
- The _Internet_ is an infrastructure, whereas the _Web_ is a service built on top of the infrastructure. It is worth noting there are several other services built on top of the Internet, such as email and [IRC](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Glossary/IRC)

## Intranets and Extranets

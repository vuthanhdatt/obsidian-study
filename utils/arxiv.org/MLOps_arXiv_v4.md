- With the increase of data availability and analytical capabilities,coupled with the constant pressure to innovate, more machinelearning products than ever are being developed — [Updated on 2022-07-11 15:48:36](https://hyp.is/QHy7BgD2Ee29Fqcyg07nvA/arxiv.org/ftp/arxiv/papers/2205/2205.02302.pdf) — Group: #Data-Engineer

- Furthermore, the academic space has focusedintensively on machine learning model building and benchmarking,but too little on operating complex machine learning systems inreal-world scenarios — [Updated on 2022-07-11 15:52:20](https://hyp.is/xi8eEAD2Ee2EewdrmfDqow/arxiv.org/ftp/arxiv/papers/2205/2205.02302.pdf) — Group: #Data-Engineer
